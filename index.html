            <p>Practicing photography has many more benefits than you might think. When you start taking pictures, you
                will not only begin to see things from a different perspective, but you will also develop a series of
                skills and abilities that will help you not only be a better photographer, but also a better person.
                Photography is an art that will require concentration, discipline and a lot of passion. You will see
                how, by practicing it, your vision of the world will expand a little more, you will be able to connect
                more with yourself and with the people around you. So, if you are going to start taking pictures, go
                ahead and grab your camera, which will not only be your tool, but also your companion on the journey
                through this fun and enriching path that is photography.</p>

                    <h2>This helps with<br> self-knowledge</h2>
                    <p>As you practice photography, you will realize that you need to learn more about yourself, as you
                        need
                        to be sure of what you want to photograph in the first place. This requires a process of
                        self-knowledge, because you need to explore what you like to do, what you want to express and
                        how
                        you are going to achieve it. Photography is a discipline that will require you to learn, not
                        only
                        about photographic technique, but about yourself, as you progress. With it, we express our
                        feelings
                        in a creative way, allowing us to express ourselves about our emotions, personal experiences,
                        what
                        we like and even what we don't like, everything that excites us, for all this and much more,
                        photography has great value as a means of expression.</p>

                    <h2>Develop creativity</h2>
                    <p>Photography will help you develop your creativity. If you want to take different photos, you need
                        to
                        connect with your creative side, and when you start practicing it with more discipline, you
                        start
                        doing a bit of “brain gymnastics,” as Gastón Enria says in his podcast. You will see how your
                        vision
                        of the world will expand and you will see everything with different eyes.</p>

                    <h2>She teaches us to have<br> different perspectives</h2>
                    <p>Furthermore, photography, by awakening the curiosity to see things from different angles, teaches
                        us
                        to have different perspectives. Not only in terms of aesthetics, but in general, you will see
                        that
                        by practicing it, you will see things from a different point of view. Remember that no one sees
                        the
                        world the way you see it. Remember that you can transform ordinary places into epic places if
                        you
                        put your mind to it. Likewise, even if they say that a familiar place has already been
                        photographed
                        a thousand times, your vision is a matter of perspective, photograph it anyway.</p>
